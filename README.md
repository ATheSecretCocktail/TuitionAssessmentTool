# Tuition Assessment Tool Release Notes Version 1.0

## New Features
Reworked the report page to feature three pie charts that compare the various costs and income of running the CNA program.

Individual courses can be excluded from the pie chart by clicking on their label above the chart.

Implemented PDF functionality, including data pertaining to every completed course and the overhead costs.

Implemented multiple course functionality, allowing the user to create multiple courses with their own unique data.
## Known Defects
Viewing the application on mobile breaks the layout of the UI.

If a course is not completed it will be misaligned textwise on the desired tuition page.
## Fixed Defects
Fixed the issue where creating too many courses used too many browser cookies, so previous cookies were being deleted. 

Limited the number of courses that can be created to 5.
